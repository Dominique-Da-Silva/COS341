### Example 1
This file will contain a simple, valid RecSPL program that uses various features of the language, such as variable declarations, a function call, a condition, and a return statement. This example will test the lexerâ€™s ability to correctly tokenize all types of tokens.

### Example 2
This file will include some lexical errors to see if the lexer can identify and report them correctly.

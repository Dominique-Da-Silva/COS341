Functions:
1. Main Program Scope: The main program forms the highest-level scope.
2. Function Declaration: Each function declaration creates its own scope.
3. Child Scope Naming: A child scope may not share the same name as its immediate parent or any of its sibling scopes within the same parent.
4. Call Command Rules: A `CALL` command may refer to an immediate child scope or its own scope (to allow recursion).
5. Main Program Recursion: Recursion to the main program is not allowed.
6. Error Reporting: If any of the above rules are violated, the system must throw an error.

Variables:
1. Unique Variable Declarations: No variable name may be declared twice in the same scope.
2. Declaration Resolution: A declared variable must be found within its own scope or in any higher ancestor scope.
3. Nearest Declaration: If a variable name is declared in multiple scopes, the nearest declaration (in terms of scope hierarchy) is the relevant version for that variable.
4. Mandatory Declaration: Every used variable name must have a valid declaration within the allowed scopes.
5. Variable vs Function Names: No variable may share the same name as a function.
6. Reserved Keywords: No variable name may be identical to a reserved keyword.
7. Scope Distinction: Two variables with the same name are considered different computational entities if they are declared in different scopes.
8. Error Handling: If any of these rules are violated, an error must be thrown.

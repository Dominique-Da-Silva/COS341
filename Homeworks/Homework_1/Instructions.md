# Question 1
a) Convert the "Numbers" NFA from the lecture (29th of July) into its corresponding DFA, either by the conversion method from COS210 or by the conversion method from our COS341 textbook.

If the resulting DFA has any acceptance state in which two different acceptance categories from the NFA are overlapping, then highlight those peculiar states with a colour.
b) Convert the "Variable names and Reserved keywords" NFA from the lecture (29th of July) into its corresponding DFA, either by the conversion method from COS210 or by the conversion method from our COS341 textbook.

If the resulting DFA has any acceptance state in which two different acceptance categories from the NFA are overlapping, then highlight those peculiar states with a colour.

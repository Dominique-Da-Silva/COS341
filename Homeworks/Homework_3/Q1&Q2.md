# Question 1	
G=(V,Σ,R,S) where

V = {S,N,M}

Σ = {a,b,c,d}

R = {
    S → NM,
    N → ab | aNb ,
    M → cd | cMd,

}

and the following conditions hold
V ∧  Σ = ∅
S ∈ V is the start variable

# Question 2
G'=(V,Σ,R',S') where

V = {S',N,M}

Σ = {a,b,c,d}

R' = {
    S' → aNd ,
    N → M | aNd ,
    M → bc | bMc,

}

and the following conditions hold
V ∧  Σ = ∅
S' ∈ V is the start variable
